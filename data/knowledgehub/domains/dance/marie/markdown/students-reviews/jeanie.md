## Feedback

Nice commitment to the work we need to practice bigger and let yourself make mistakes so you can eventually get the foundations more in your body. Levels and attack of the movements is needed keep working on the bounce it can be very small we need to see the levels and the bounce in the levels rock need more work and we need to find are groove.

We need to work on your hiphop posture. Lean more and bend your nkees your too up staght in the across the floors. We are often loading and late because we are hesitation with more practice or more years of experience this will come. Especially when your dancing with people with 4-5 years experience. We need to push even harder in class because awe are playing catchup.
