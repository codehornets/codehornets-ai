Good understanding of bounce but needs to relax in the movement especially stiff in the upper body and shoulders to calm in your movement we are missing a little attack and intensity at times bit good coordinations. Keep working on your grooves in your robocops

In general I would like tp see more commitment. You have natural ability but often don't push yourself to your mask, you are ok with just getting by and being comfortable. Would love to see more hard work and dedication.
