Nice posture in bounce more commitment

Feels like your marking a lot of your stuff. You are more passive in these exercises would like you to be more committed and clear with the foundations.

To up in your stance and movements. We need to get lower

Looks for break when I'm. Not watching but I see

Keep the lightness and bounce in the different hiphop movements

I think we can be more proactive and full out in class during the learning we are marked and passive in our learning so it reflect the cleanly ness and clarity of things especially since you have a good base. I believe you have much much more room to grow. Its up to you to use your time a practice wisely to its full potential but I do believe you are falling short of your potential.
