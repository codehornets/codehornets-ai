## Feedback

Good bounce keep working on the variety of musicality and textures in the bounce as well as the levels. We can relax the rock more and find different directions of the rock

Get more lower and grounded in you across the floors

Lower in all your moves across the floor keep more bounce in your movements

Practique pas quand je démontre et demande que tous le fait
