## Feedback

Good energy in the rock and bounce. Use your shoulders a lil more in the rock make sure the comic in you is able to come through but that it doesnt effect your quality of bounce or rock. Not fully committed in the grooves sometimes your are disconnected that you are only walking.

Practique pas quand je démontre et demande que tous le fait

In general more commitment to everything. Be more sincere in your work and learning time because you have a good facility now we just have to use it.
