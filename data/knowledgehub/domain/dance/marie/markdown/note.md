1. Abigaelle: good bounce we can push a little more. You have nice movement we need to be more clear and defined with are rocks and you need to say consistent in your work during the rock bounce and groove. Sometimes your committed and others you are more passive.

Wu tang is the wrong direction of movement


2. Alexia: better style. Bigger moves a little stiff in the upper body. I see you working on shoulders isolation but they tend to be tiff work on more lightness in your moves and amplitude.

Bounce can be more clear with bigger levels. Good focus. Release your tension in your neck going across the floor sit lower in all your moves. I do see you working with more smooth moments and that is great. If you add more rolls on your body you will have more fluidity. Robe cop is missing some groves


3. Aurelie: good energy in the rock and bounce. Use your shoulders a lil more in the rock make sure the comic in you is able to come through but that it doesnt effect your quality of bounce or rock. Not fully committed in the grooves sometimes your are disconnected that you are only walking.

Practique pas quand je démontre et demande que tous le fait

In general more commitment to everything. Be more sincere in your work and learning time because you have a good facility now we just have to use it.


4. Bea: good understanding of bounce but needs to relax in the movement especially stiff in the upper body and shoulders to calm in your movement we are missing a little attack and intensity at times bit good coordinations. Keep working on your grooves in your robocops

In general I would like tp see more commitment. You have natural ability but often don't push yourself to your mask, you are ok with just getting by and being comfortable. Would love to see more hard work and dedication.


5. Bile: good energy in bounce good rock but you tend to put your hands on your shirt when you do your rocks and often they are the same keep exploring directions and textures

Good commitment in the whole exercise

Really pushed in the evaluation

Really worked hard and has a lot of improvement since last year. Nice attack. Wrong direction in wu tang


6. Choe: good bounce keep working on the variety of musicality and textures in the bounce as well as the levels. We can relax the rock more and find different directions of the rock

Get more lower and grounded in you across the floors

Lower in all your moves across the floor keep more bounce in your movements

Practique pas quand je démontre et demande que tous le fait


7. Chloe: keep a good rhythm in bounces and loosens up we need deeper levels in the bouncedont use your arms too much make sure the bounce iOS coming from the legs not arms


8. Ellie: relax the neck across the floor we can relax upper body and take more place in class


9. Eva: nice posture in bounce more commitment

Feels like your marking a lot of your stuff. You are more passive in these exercises would like you to be more committed and clear with the foundations.

To up in your stance and movements. We need to get lower

Looks for break when I'm. Not watching but I see

Keep the lightness and bounce in the different hiphop movements

I think we can be more proactive and full out in class during the learning we are marked and passive in our learning so it reflect the cleanly ness and clarity of things especially since you have a good base. I believe you have much much more room to grow. Its up to you to use your time a practice wisely to its full potential but I do believe you are falling short of your potential.


10. Eva belle: push your grooves more especially in the robocop lower in all your movements

Good bounce now it needs to be bigger. We are on track but need more clarity and pronunciation in moves. Learning ability can be faster but that will come with more experience


11. India: good energy and full out bounce can be more constant with lower levels and make sure to use your hips and direction with the rock to have more variety and bigger movement in the rock. You often do move on your heels makes sure it is your toes unless specified to go on your heels


12. Jane: more energy and full out for bounce keep finding more connection with the music in your rocks. Sometimes you leave the rock and bounce. Keep developing the differences and clarity between the rock and bounce

More body in Reebok

Keep working on the coordination in the across the floor

More energy and commitment in the across the floors


13. Jeanie: nice commitment to the work we need to practice bigger and let yourself make mistakes so you can eventually get the foundations more in your body. Levels and attack of the movements is needed keep working on the bounce it can be very small we need to see the levels and the bounce in the levels rock need more work and we need to find are groove.

We need to work on your hiphop posture. Lean more and bend your nkees your too up staght in the across the floors. We are often loading and late because we are hesitation with more practice or more years of experience this will come. Especially when your dancing with people with 4-5 years experience. We need to push even harder in class because awe are playing catchup.


14. Kaila: more rebound in the bounces. We need more levels in the bounce especially since you are very tall. I appreciate the exploration of different musicality now you want that to be more flowy and seamless into your musicality choices so it is seamless. When the moves are fast lets your upper body relax more we have a lot of tension in your hands release the tension in the fingers to be more expressive hands.


15. Kailua: playing with musicality in bounce is nice but more amplitude in bounce and lightness


16. Kellyann: nice flow and softness to your bounce we can have more and deeper levels in the bounces and release the neck


17. Leanne: good improvement in bounce keep dancing with head and neck let it move and push the bounces deeper. Over all good needs to pop out more relax upper body and dance with head the body is moving well and much improvement. Take more solace in your dance and call more attention to you. Don't nee to be humble the whole time.


18. Ma er: great musicality and style and fluidity nice choices we can work on the different nuances and really getting into the pocket if the musicality challenge yourself to step out of the confort zone so you can keep development the knowledge of your skills. Sty to speak a story and idea then just moving now that your understanding the foundations and have a nice quality of it


19. Maeva: good improvements. Sit lower in your bounce and be more sure of your decision and when you make choice don't do them in vain make sure their is a reason a feeling for it a lotvof tongue in facials


20. Marianne: can be more clear and exact in the bounces good connection to the music in your rocks keeps pushing the range and consistency of the rock


21. Melrose: good bounce relax shoulders, neck and head in the bounce. A little stiff in the rock it needs to breath more and you can use your shoulders a little more. Don't look at the floor stay committed. I can see that your working on your understand of groove and you have the right idea so keep pushing it.

When I gave the correction of being less stif and more relaxed you stepped up to the challenge

The most improvement but keep working on articulation and clarity of movement


22. Olivia: good energy and big bounce. We have a good understanding of the foundations now we need to work on not holding your shirt to much on the rock. Use you head and neck and musicality a little more on the rocks.


23. Rafaelle: good person to have in class, you listen and are respectful we need to work on endurance and resilience. More muscle endurance may help you have more attack and fire behind your movement I liked seeing you in the front line. You have improved so much in you coordination now you have show the feeling of the music and bring life to the steps


24. Rosalie: good energy and full out. Deeper bounces and lower levels, keep the rock steady not just chest isolations and you can use more hips in your rock. Your arms don't find its full extension open your range of movement and your arms


25. Romy: good understanding of the foundations but we can grow outside of what we already know ow and try to really apply the concepts that we are working on in class. Lower bounce bigger rock using your hands to move through the space with you. When the chores is fast you need to still articulate all your movements


26. Sophie: good energy and attack nice comprehension of the rock sometimes in the attack of the movement it becomes stiff let its breath and even if the energy is high. Use your hips to really amplify the rock even when the movement is fast go all the way to the end of the moves
