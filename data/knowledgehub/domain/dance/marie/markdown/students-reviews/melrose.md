## Feedback

Good bounce relax shoulders, neck and head in the bounce. A little stiff in the rock it needs to breath more and you can use your shoulders a little more. Don't look at the floor stay committed. I can see that your working on your understand of groove and you have the right idea so keep pushing it.

When I gave the correction of being less stif and more relaxed you stepped up to the challenge

The most improvement but keep working on articulation and clarity of movement
