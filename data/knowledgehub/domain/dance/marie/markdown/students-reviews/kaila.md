## Feedback

More rebound in the bounces. We need more levels in the bounce especially since you are very tall. I appreciate the exploration of different musicality now you want that to be more flowy and seamless into your musicality choices so it is seamless. When the moves are fast lets your upper body relax more we have a lot of tension in your hands release the tension in the fingers to be more expressive hands.
