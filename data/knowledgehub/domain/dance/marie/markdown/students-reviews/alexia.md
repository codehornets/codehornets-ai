Better style. Bigger moves a little stiff in the upper body. I see you working on shoulders isolation but they tend to be tiff work on more lightness in your moves and amplitude.

Bounce can be more clear with bigger levels. Good focus. Release your tension in your neck going across the floor sit lower in all your moves. I do see you working with more smooth moments and that is great. If you add more rolls on your body you will have more fluidity. Robe cop is missing some groves
