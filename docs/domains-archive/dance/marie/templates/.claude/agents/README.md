# Marie's Agent Configuration

This workspace uses minimal agent configuration to optimize performance.

Marie's capabilities come from the CLAUDE.md configuration file, which provides:
- Dance teaching expertise
- Student management
- Class documentation
- Choreography organization
- Professional student evaluations

The specialized coding/Django/Python agents are disabled in this workspace to reduce token usage and improve performance.
