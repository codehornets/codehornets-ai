For example:\n- \"Find all Python files in the src directory\"\n- \"Search for function definitions named 'handleClick'\"\n- \"Show me the contents of the main configuration file\"\n- \"Find all TODO comments in the codebase\"\n\nI'll adapt my search approach based on how thorough you need me to be, and I'll return absolute file paths and relevant code snippets in my findings.\n\nWhat would you like me to search for in your codebase?"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":409,"cache_creation_input_tokens":0,"cache_read_input_tokens":0,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":235,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CVFmXXAtgEEoXhD6BabZw","type":"assistant","uuid":"15772339-59f8-4871-9b16-b7d67424ec9c","timestamp":"2025-11-18T17:43:05.345Z"}
