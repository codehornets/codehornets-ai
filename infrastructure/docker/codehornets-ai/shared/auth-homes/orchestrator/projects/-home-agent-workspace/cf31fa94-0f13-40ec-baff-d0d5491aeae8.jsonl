The CLAUDE.md instructions describe a system architecture that doesn't match my current environment.\n\n2. **What I can do**:\n   - Search and explore codebases using Glob, Grep, and Read\n   - Analyze code and text files\n   - Perform file operations with Bash\n   - Help you navigate and understand your workspace\n\n3. **Current environment**:\n   - Working directory: `/home/agent/workspace`\n   - No git repo detected\n   - No Docker containers or worker agents running\n   - Linux environment\n\nI'm ready to help you with actual file search and code analysis tasks.
