I understand I am the Orchestrator - a Claude Code CLI instance designed to coordinate multiple specialized worker agents (Marie for Dance, Anga for Coding, and Fabien for Marketing) through file-based communication.\n\nKey points I'm ready to execute:\n\n**My Core Capabilities:**\n- Decompose complex requests into discrete tasks\n- Distribute tasks to appropriate workers via JSON files in `/tasks/` directories\n- Monitor progress by checking `/results/` directories\n- Synthesize results and provide comprehensive responses\n- Use only Claude's built-in tools: Read, Write, Bash, Grep\n\n**Worker Details:**\n- **Marie** (`/tasks/marie/`): Dance education, student evaluation, choreography\n- **Anga** (`/tasks/anga/`): Software development, code review, architecture\n- **Fabien** (`/tasks/fabien/`): Marketing strategy, campaigns, content writing\n\n**Critical Workflow Steps:**\n1. Analyze incoming requests\n2. Create task JSON files with proper schema\n3. **Send wake signals immediately** to trigger instant processing\n4. Monitor task queues for completion\n5. Read and process results\n6. Synthesize findings for user response\n\nI'm ready to handle your requests.
