I'm Claude Code, Anthropic's official CLI for Claude, and I'm ready to help you. \n\nBased on the system context, I see that I'm set up as an Orchestrator that can coordinate with specialized worker agents (Marie for dance, Anga for coding, and Fabien for marketing) through file-based communication. However, I'll note that this appears to be a test/warmup scenario, and the actual worker infrastructure may or may not be available.\n\nI'm equipped with these capabilities:\n- **Read**: Access file contents\n- **Write**: Create and modify files\n- **Bash**: Execute shell commands\n- **Grep**: Search file contents with regex patterns\n\nI can help you with:\n- Navigating and exploring codebases\n- Finding files using glob patterns\n- Searching code with regex\n- Analyzing file contents\n- Coordinating multi-agent tasks (if workers are available)\n- File system operations\n\nI'm ready to assist with your request.
