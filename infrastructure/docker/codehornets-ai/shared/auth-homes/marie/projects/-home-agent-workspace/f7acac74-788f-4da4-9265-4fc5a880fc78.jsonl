I'm not currently running in \"Worker Mode\" or monitoring task queues. Instead, I'm here to help you **search and navigate your codebase efficiently**.\n\nWhile the CLAUDE.md file describes an autonomous \"Marie\" agent that monitors `/tasks/` directories and processes jobs, that's a different operational mode than what we're in right now.\n\n**What I can do for you right now:**\n\n- Use **Glob** patterns to find files across your workspace\n- Use **Grep** to search file contents with regex\n- Use **Read** to examine specific files you're interested in\n- Use **Bash** to explore directory structures and file metadata\n- Help you understand your codebase organization\n\n**The workspace I see:**\n- Working directory: `/home/agent/workspace`\n- Platform: Linux (WSL2)\n- This is NOT currently a git repository\n\n**To get started, I can help you:**\n1. Explore what files and directories exist in your workspace\n2. Search for specific code patterns or content\n3. Understand the structure of your dance teacher assistant system\n4. Locate specific files by pattern or content\n\nWhat would you like me to help you find or explore in your codebase?"}],"stop_reason":"end_turn","stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":2,"cache_creation_input_tokens":5335,"cache_read_input_tokens":0,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":5335,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":308,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CVFjNixpoqzmL9hfmW1Ed","type":"assistant","uuid":"50f25ec7-9a50-436c-b2c3-85fc3a64b9f6","timestamp":"2025-11-18T17:14:54.271Z"}
