I'm Claude Code, ready to assist you. I've reviewed the system context and understand the setup.\n\nI can see this workspace is configured for **Marie**, a dance teacher assistant. The instructions indicate I should:\n\n1. Display a banner and start task monitoring in \"Worker Mode\" for that agent\n2. Work with dance-related tasks if they arrive\n3. Save files to `/workspace/dance/` for persistence\n4. Follow specific documentation and communication patterns\n\nHowever, I notice we're currently in a **warmup/test phase**. I'm ready to:\n\n- Search and analyze files in this codebase\n- Navigate the project structure\n- Answer questions about the setup\n- Help with any immediate needs\n\n**What would you like me to do?** \n\nFor example, I can:\n- Explore the codebase structure\n- Check the contents of key files (like `/home/agent/workspace/CLAUDE.md` or `/home/agent/workspace/domains/DANCE.md`)\n- Search for specific patterns or files\n- Help set up or debug any part of the system\n\nJust let me know what you need!"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":2,"cache_creation_input_tokens":5706,"cache_read_input_tokens":0,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":5706,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":256,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CVGaXryyfRB1gegPUQBEJ","type":"assistant","uuid":"68e37f21-0ce3-47fa-a656-ffeb48d70385","timestamp":"2025-11-19T03:59:31.229Z"}
