# Save Conversation Memory Log

Create a comprehensive conversation memory log capturing our entire session.

## Steps:

1. **Read the template**: Read `conversation_memory_template.md` to understand the structure

2. **Analyze the conversation**: Review our entire conversation and identify:
   - The original problem/question and how it evolved
   - Key insights, recommendations, and solutions developed
   - User's working style, preferences, and communication patterns observed
   - Effective collaboration approaches identified
   - Any clarifications or corrections that changed direction
   - Specific project context or examples discussed
   - Templates, frameworks, or processes established
   - Next steps or follow-up areas identified

3. **Create the memory log**:
   - Generate filename: `conversation_memory_log_YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM.md` (use current date and time)
   - Fill out all sections comprehensively
   - Focus on practical patterns and preferences for future sessions
   - Include specific examples and concrete details
   - Write the "Quick Reference" summary paragraph

4. **Save the file**: Write the completed memory log to the workspace root

5. **Confirm**: Show the user where the file was saved and provide a brief summary of what was captured

## Important:
- Be thorough - this is for re-establishing context in future conversations
- Focus on actionable insights, not just summaries
- Capture working style nuances and collaboration patterns
- Include specific project details, tech stack, and current state
