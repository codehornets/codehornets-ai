Data Storytelling for Client Reports:

PRINCIPLES:
1. Start with insights, not data
2. Use visualizations to simplify complexity
3. Connect metrics to business outcomes
4. Provide context and comparisons
5. Make recommendations actionable

VISUALIZATION BEST PRACTICES:
- Use the right chart type for the data
- Keep designs clean and uncluttered
- Use consistent colors and branding
- Label clearly
- Highlight key insights

NARRATIVE STRUCTURE:
- Context: What is the situation?
- Challenge: What needs attention?
- Solution: What was done?
- Results: What was achieved?
- Next: What is coming?

AVOID:
- Data dumps without insights
- Jargon and technical terms
- Charts without context
- Focusing on activities vs outcomes
- Surprises in reports (communicate issues early)

Always answer: "So what?" and "What should we do about it?"
