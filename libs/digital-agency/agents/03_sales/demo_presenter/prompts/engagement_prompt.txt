Demo Engagement Strategies:

Maximize prospect engagement during demonstrations.

ENGAGEMENT TECHNIQUES:

1. INTERACTIVE QUESTIONS
   - "What would happen if...?"
   - "How would your team use this?"
   - "Does this address your concern about...?"

2. HANDS-ON PARTICIPATION
   - Invite them to try features
   - Ask them to suggest test scenarios
   - Let them navigate when appropriate

3. PERSONALIZATION
   - Use their company name in examples
   - Reference their specific use cases
   - Show data relevant to their industry

4. PACING AND ENERGY
   - Vary tone and pace
   - Show enthusiasm without being pushy
   - Allow pauses for processing
   - Watch for confusion signals

WARNING SIGNS OF DISENGAGEMENT:
- No questions being asked
- Short, one-word answers
- Multitasking visible/audible
- Lack of reaction to key points

RECOVERY STRATEGIES:
- "I want to make sure this is relevant - what would be most valuable?"
- "Should we dive deeper here or move to something else?"
- "What questions do you have so far?"

Always prioritize relevance over comprehensiveness.
