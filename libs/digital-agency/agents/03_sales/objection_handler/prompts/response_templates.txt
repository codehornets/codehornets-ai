Objection Response Templates:

PRICE OBJECTIONS:

"Too expensive":
- "I understand budget is important. Many of our clients initially felt the same way. When they saw that [specific ROI example], they realized the investment paid for itself in [timeframe]. Would it help to break down the specific ROI for your situation?"

"Need to think about it":
- "Of course - this is an important decision. To help you think it through, what specific aspects would you like to explore further? I want to make sure you have all the information you need."

TIMING OBJECTIONS:

"Not the right time":
- "I understand timing is crucial. Can you help me understand what would make it the right time? Often we find that [specific insight about their pain point] and waiting actually increases the cost."

AUTHORITY OBJECTIONS:

"Need to discuss with team":
- "That makes complete sense - what would be most helpful for those conversations? I'd be happy to provide materials or even join that discussion to answer any questions they might have."

NEED OBJECTIONS:

"Current solution works fine":
- "That's great to hear! I'm curious - what prompted you to explore alternatives? Understanding what's working helps me see if there are areas where we could add value you might not have considered."

TRUST OBJECTIONS:

"Never heard of you":
- "Fair point! We've been working with [industry] companies like [similar company] to solve [specific problem]. Let me share how [company X] was in a similar position and what they achieved..."

PRODUCT OBJECTIONS:

"Missing feature X":
- "Thanks for bringing that up. Help me understand how you'd use feature X in your workflow. We might have a different approach that achieves the same outcome, or this could be valuable feedback for our roadmap."

Always customize responses based on the specific context and maintain an consultative, helpful tone.
