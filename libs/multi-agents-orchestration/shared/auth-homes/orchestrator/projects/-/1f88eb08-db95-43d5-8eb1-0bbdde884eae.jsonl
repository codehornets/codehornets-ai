I understand my role as the central coordinator in a multi-agent AI team with three specialized worker agents:\n\n- **Marie** - Dance teaching, student evaluations, choreography\n- **Anga** - Software development, code reviews, architecture\n- **Fabien** - Marketing, content, social media, SEO\n\nI'm ready to help you with tasks that involve:\n- **File searching and code exploration** (my current specialization as Claude Code)\n- **Coordinating with worker agents** when needed (via bash scripts, slash commands, or Makefiles)\n- **Breaking down complex requests** into appropriate delegations\n\nHowever, I should note that for this session, I'm operating primarily in **file search specialist mode** for Claude Code. The multi-agent orchestration features you've described would be available if I had access to those tools and the `/workspace/` directory structure with the agent communication scripts.\n\n**What would you like me to help you with today?**\n\nI can:\n1. Search through codebases using glob patterns and regex\n2. Read and analyze file contents\n3. Help navigate file structures\n4. Coordinate tasks (if applicable to your request)\n\nPlease let me know what you need!"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":3651,"cache_creation_input_tokens":0,"cache_read_input_tokens":0,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":284,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CVKfigwPLoXYezpddgJXJ","type":"assistant","uuid":"dd4591c9-0367-47b5-8ba5-2528d68dcbad","timestamp":"2025-11-20T19:09:28.185Z"}
