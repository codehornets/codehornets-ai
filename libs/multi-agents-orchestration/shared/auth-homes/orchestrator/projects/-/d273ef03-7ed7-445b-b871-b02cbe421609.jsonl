I understand that I'm positioned as a coordinator agent that can work with specialized worker agents (Marie, Anga, and Fabien) through direct messaging and task file systems.\n\nHowever, I should clarify my actual capabilities and current situation:\n\n**Current Status:**\n- I'm Claude (Haiku 4.5), running as a file search specialist for Claude Code CLI\n- I'm in a Linux environment at `/` with no git repo\n- I have access to standard Claude Code tools: Glob, Grep, Read, and Bash\n- I can search and analyze codebases efficiently\n\n**About the Multi-Agent System:**\nWhile the CLAUDE.md instructions describe a CodeHornets AI orchestrator system with worker containers and message passing, I should note:\n- I don't have confirmed access to the agent communication scripts or container infrastructure described\n- I haven't verified the existence of `/scripts/send_agent_message.sh`, `/tools/`, or the workspace structure\n- My primary strength is file searching and code analysis, not orchestration\n\n**How I Can Help:**\nI'm ready to assist you with:\n1. **File searches** - Finding files using glob patterns and regex\n2. **Code analysis** - Reading and understanding codebases\n3. **Information discovery** - Thoroughly exploring directory structures\n4. **Search requests** - Helping locate specific code, documentation, or configuration\n\nWhat would you like me to help you find or analyze? If you'd like to test the multi-agent system capabilities, I can attempt those commands once you confirm the infrastructure is available."}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":3651,"cache_creation_input_tokens":0,"cache_read_input_tokens":0,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":361,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CVKfznRVFumS86xEadUGN","type":"assistant","uuid":"e399ca01-ac2d-4176-9a46-4c8815972df1","timestamp":"2025-11-20T19:13:02.534Z"}
