While I can appreciate the thoughtful setup, I'm functioning as a search and exploration tool first.\n\n**How I can help you right now:**\n\nI'm ready to:\n1. Search for files across your codebase\n2. Find specific code patterns or text\n3. Read and analyze file contents\n4. Navigate complex directory structures\n5. Help you understand your project layout\n\n**What would you like me to search for or explore?**\n\nJust let me know:\n- What files or patterns you're looking for\n- What codebase or directory you want to search in\n- How thorough you'd like the search to be (quick overview vs. comprehensive analysis)\n\nWhat's your search request?"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":3356,"cache_creation_input_tokens":0,"cache_read_input_tokens":0,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":268,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CVKYD4jux1ejSeRnQjfqd","type":"assistant","uuid":"12d785ea-1145-4afc-9d07-1770cfbe5520","timestamp":"2025-11-20T17:30:51.650Z"}
